# Daniel Frederick

As a Computer Science student at the University of Dayton, I have acquired hands-on experience as a Software Engineer Intern at Radiance Technologies and as a Software Developer at Flyer Enterprises. These roles have provided me with the opportunity to apply my technical skills in real-world projects, contributing to both desktop and full-stack development. I’m passionate about problem-solving, continuous learning, and driving innovation through technology, and I’m always looking for new opportunities to further grow as a software engineer.
